### 1. Introduction
Eco-Cycle is an online platform aimed at facilitating the exchange of recycled materials between manufacturers and recyclers. This document outlines the user requirements for the Eco-Cycle platform.

### 2. User Profiles
Eco-Cycle will have two main user profiles:
- **Manufacturers:** Companies or individuals involved in manufacturing processes. They are interested in sourcing recycled materials for their production needs.
- **Recyclers:** Entities engaged in the collection and processing of recyclable materials. They seek to sell their recycled materials to manufacturers.

### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 Registration and Authentication
- **Requirement 1:** Users should be able to register for an account on Eco-Cycle, providing necessary information such as name, email, password, and company details (for manufacturers).
- **Requirement 2:** Registered users must be able to securely log in to the platform using their email and password.
- **Requirement 3:** Email verification should be implemented to ensure the validity of user accounts.

#### 3.2 Material Listings
- **Requirement 4:** Recyclers should be able to create detailed listings for recycled materials they have available for sale, including type, quantity, price, location, and quality certifications.
- **Requirement 5:** Manufacturers should be able to search and filter material listings based on various criteria such as material type, quantity, price range, location, and quality standards.
- **Requirement 6:** Manufacturers should be able to view detailed information about available recycled materials, including images, descriptions, and seller ratings.
- **Requirement 7:** Users should have the ability to bookmark or save favorite listings for future reference.

#### 3.3 Transaction Management
- **Requirement 8:** Manufacturers should be able to initiate purchase requests for desired recycled materials, specifying quantity, delivery preferences, and payment terms.
- **Requirement 9:** Recyclers should receive purchase requests and be able to accept, negotiate, or decline based on availability and pricing.
- **Requirement 10:** Once agreed, recyclers should be able to finalize transactions, update inventory, and arrange for delivery.
- **Requirement 11:** Both manufacturers and recyclers should be able to track the status of orders from initiation to completion, including order history, shipment tracking, and delivery confirmation.
- **Requirement 12:** Users should have the option to leave feedback or ratings for completed transactions.

#### 3.4 Communication
- **Requirement 13:** Eco-Cycle should provide a built-in messaging system for direct communication between manufacturers and recyclers regarding specific listings, purchase inquiries, negotiation, and order fulfillment.
- **Requirement 14:** Users should receive email notifications for important updates such as new listings, purchase requests, order status changes, and messages received.
- **Requirement 15:** Users should have the option to set communication preferences, such as email frequency and notification settings.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.1 Performance
- **Requirement 16:** The platform should respond to user actions within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Requirement 17:** Eco-Cycle should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and listings without significant performance degradation, utilizing scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

#### 4.2 Security
- **Requirement 18:** User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
- **Requirement 19:** Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.
- **Requirement 20:** The platform should support multi-factor authentication for added security.

#### 4.3 Usability
- **Requirement 21:** The user interface should be designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use, with intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action buttons.
- **Requirement 22:** Eco-Cycle should comply with accessibility standards (such as WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Requirement 23:** The platform should be responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.

### 5. Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumption 1:** Users will have access to internet-enabled devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers) to access the Eco-Cycle platform.
- **Assumption 2:** Users are familiar with basic internet operations, such as browsing, form filling, and email communication.
- **Assumption 3:** Recyclers will provide accurate and honest descriptions of their materials, including quality certifications.
- **Assumption 4:** Manufacturers will have a genuine interest in purchasing recycled materials and will honor agreed-upon transactions.

- **Dependency 1:** Integration with third-party services for payment processing (such as Stripe or PayPal) to facilitate secure online transactions.
- **Dependency 2:** Utilization of cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) to ensure platform scalability, reliability, and performance.
- **Dependency 3:** Dependence on third-party APIs for features such as email verification, SMS notifications, and shipment tracking.
- **Dependency 4:** Regular updates and maintenance to ensure platform security, compliance with standards, and feature enhancements.
- **Dependency 5:** Collaboration with industry organizations for quality certification standards to ensure credibility and trustworthiness of material listings.

### 6. Reporting and Analytics
- **Requirement 24:** The platform should provide analytics and reporting tools for users to track their transactions, material listings, and communication history.
- **Requirement 25:** Eco-Cycle should offer dashboard features for manufacturers and recyclers to visualize key metrics such as purchase trends, inventory levels, and user ratings.
- **Requirement 26:** Administrators should have access to comprehensive reports on platform usage, user activity, transaction volumes, and system performance.

### 7. Administrative Functions
- **Requirement 27:** The platform should include an administrative panel for managing user accounts, monitoring transactions, and overseeing platform activity.
- **Requirement 28:** Administrators should have the ability to approve or reject user registrations, particularly for recyclers, to ensure quality control.
- **Requirement 29:** Admins should be able to moderate user-generated content, such as material listings and feedback, to maintain platform integrity.
- **Requirement 30:** The system should support audit trails to log and monitor all critical actions performed by users and administrators for accountability.

### 8. Legal and Compliance
- **Requirement 31:** Eco-Cycle must comply with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR for users in the EU and CCPA for users in California.

1\. Introduction
----------------

The Eco-Cycle project aims to develop an online platform that connects manufacturers and recyclers for the efficient exchange of recycled materials. The platform's goal is to streamline the process of sourcing and selling recycled materials, promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility in manufacturing processes. By providing a centralized marketplace, Eco-Cycle enables manufacturers to find suitable recycled materials and recyclers to showcase their available inventory.

2\. Scope
---------

Eco-Cycle will provide the following key functionalities:

### User Registration and Authentication

-   Users can register as either manufacturers or recyclers by providing necessary details such as name, email, password, and company information.
-   Secure login process for registered users with email verification and password encryption.
-   Profile management for users to update their contact information, company details, and preferences.

### Material Listings

-   Recyclers can create detailed listings for recycled materials they have available for sale, including material type, quantity, price, location, and quality certifications.
-   Manufacturers can search and filter materials based on various criteria such as material type, quantity, price range, location, and quality standards.
-   Manufacturers can view detailed information about available recycled materials, including images, descriptions, and seller ratings.

### Transaction Management

-   Manufacturers can initiate purchase requests for desired recycled materials directly from the platform, specifying quantity, delivery preferences, and payment terms.
-   Recyclers receive purchase requests and can accept, negotiate, or decline based on availability and pricing.
-   Once agreed, recyclers can finalize transactions, update inventory, and arrange for delivery.
-   Both manufacturers and recyclers can track the status of orders from initiation to completion, including order history, shipment tracking, and delivery confirmation.

### Communication

-   Built-in messaging system for direct communication between manufacturers and recyclers regarding specific listings, purchase inquiries, negotiation, and order fulfillment.
-   Email notifications for important updates such as new listings, purchase requests, order status changes, and messages received.

### Reporting and Analytics

-   Reporting and analytics functionality to provide insights into user activities, such as transaction history, popular materials, and user ratings.

3\. Functional Requirements
---------------------------

### 3.1 User Management

#### Registration

-   Users can register as either manufacturers or recyclers by providing necessary details such as name, email, password, and company information.
-   The registration process should validate the input data and ensure uniqueness of email addresses.
-   Upon successful registration, users should receive a verification email to activate their accounts.

#### Authentication

-   Secure login process for registered users with email verification and password encryption.
-   Users should be able to reset their passwords in case they forget them.

#### Profile Management

-   Users should be able to update their profiles, including contact information, company details, and preferences.
-   The profile update process should validate the input data and ensure data consistency.

### 3.2 Material Listings

#### Create Listings

-   Recyclers should be able to create detailed listings for recycled materials they have available for sale.
-   The listing creation process should include fields for material type, quantity, price, location, and quality certifications.
-   The system should validate the input data and ensure data consistency.

#### Search and Filter

-   Manufacturers should be able to search and filter materials based on various criteria such as material type, quantity, price range, location, and quality standards.
-   The search and filter functionality should provide accurate and relevant results based on the specified criteria.

#### View Listings

-   Manufacturers should be able to view detailed information about available recycled materials.
-   The listing details should include images, descriptions, and seller ratings.

### 3.3 Transaction Management

#### Buying

-   Manufacturers should be able to initiate purchase requests for desired recycled materials directly from the platform.
-   The purchase request should include details such as quantity, delivery preferences, and payment terms.

#### Selling

-   Recyclers should receive purchase requests and be able to accept, negotiate, or decline based on availability and pricing.
-   Once agreed, recyclers should be able to finalize transactions, update inventory, and arrange for delivery.

#### Order Management

-   Both manufacturers and recyclers should be able to track the status of orders from initiation to completion.
-   The order management functionality should include order history, shipment tracking, and delivery confirmation.
-   user can view purchase request history and managing sales history.

### 3.4 Communication

#### Messaging

-   The platform should provide a built-in messaging system for direct communication between manufacturers and recyclers.
-   Users should be able to send and receive messages regarding specific listings, purchase inquiries, negotiation, and order fulfillment.

#### Notifications

-   Users should receive email notifications for important updates such as new listings, purchase requests, order status changes, and messages received.

4\. Non-Functional Requirements
-------------------------------

### 4.1 Performance

#### Response Time

-   The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
-   Performance testing should be conducted to identify and optimize any bottlenecks.

#### Scalability

-   The platform should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and listings without significant performance degradation.
-   Scalable cloud-based infrastructure, such as AWS or Azure, should be utilized to ensure scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

### 4.2 Security

#### Data Encryption

-   User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
-   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption should be implemented for data transmission over the internet.
-   Added points on regular security audits, logging for auditing purposes, and data backup mechanisms.

#### Access Control

-   Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.
-   User authentication and authorization should be enforced for all system interactions.

### 4.3 Usability

#### Intuitive Interface

-   The user interface should be designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use.
-   Intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action buttons should be provided to guide users through the platform.
-   Added user feedback mechanisms and customizable text sizes/color contrast options.

#### Accessibility

-   The platform should comply with accessibility standards (such as WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities.

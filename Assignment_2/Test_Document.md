### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the testing plan for the Eco-Cycle project. It includes the objectives, scope, testing strategy, detailed test cases, test environment, schedule, and defect management process.

### 2. Test Plan

#### 2.1 Objectives
- Ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are met.
- Identify and fix defects before the production release.
- Validate the performance, security, and usability of the Eco-Cycle platform.

#### 2.2 Scope
The scope of testing includes all features and functionalities outlined in the SRS and URD documents, focusing on user management, material listings, transaction management, and communication.

#### 2.3 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual components by developers.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that components interact correctly.
- **System Testing:** Validate the end-to-end functionality of the platform.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Confirm the platform meets user requirements and expectations.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess the platform's responsiveness and stability under load.
- **Security Testing:** Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **API Testing:** Evaluate the reliability, performance, and security of the API endpoints to ensure they handle requests and responses correctly, adhere to expected functionality, and maintain data integrity.

### 3. Test Cases

#### 3.1 User Management
- **TC01:** Verify user registration with valid and invalid data.
- **TC02:** Verify email verification process.
- **TC03:** Verify login functionality with correct and incorrect credentials.
- **TC04:** Verify profile update process.

#### 3.2 Material Listings
- **TC05:** Verify listing creation by recyclers with valid and invalid data.
- **TC06:** Verify search functionality with various criteria.
- **TC07:** Verify detailed view of listings.
- **TC08:** Verify bookmarking/saving of listings.

#### 3.3 Transaction Management
- **TC09:** Verify purchase request initiation by manufacturers.
- **TC10:** Verify recyclers' ability to accept, negotiate, or decline purchase requests.

- **TC18**: Verify API endpoint for profile updates.
- **TC19:** Verify API endpoint for listing creation with valid and invalid data.
- **TC20:** Verify API endpoint for search functionality with various criteria.
- **TC21:** Verify API endpoint for purchase request initiation.
- **TC22:** Verify API endpoint for transaction finalization and inventory update.
- **TC23:** Verify API endpoint for order tracking and history.
- **TC24:** Verify API endpoint for messaging system functionality.
- **TC25:** Verify API endpoint for email notifications.
- **TC26:** Verify API performance under load.

### 4. Test Environment
- **Development Environment:** Local development setup with mock data.
- **Test Environment:** Staging server replicating the production environment for comprehensive testing.
- **Production Environment:** Live server where the final version will be deployed.

### 5. Test Schedule
- **Unit Testing:** Weeks 1-2
- **Integration Testing:** Weeks 3-4
- **API Testing:** Weeks 4-5
- **System Testing:** Weeks 5-6
- **Acceptance Testing:** Weeks 7-8
- **Performance and Security Testing:** Weeks 9-10

### 6. Defect Management
- **Defect Tracking Tool:** JIRA or similar tool for logging and tracking defects.
- **Defect Lifecycle:** Identification -> Logging -> Prioritization -> Assignment -> Resolution -> Verification -> Closure.
- **Priority Levels:** Critical, High, Medium, Low based on the impact and severity of the defect.
